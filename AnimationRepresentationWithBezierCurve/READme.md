Note:
	The elements of Animation Curve (for instance X, Y, Z axis) have to be the same of weight, else It's won't working right.
	I can not fix it as well, It is limitation of the Bezier Curve.
	When yhou use a custom weight, it's no longer a cubic bezier, so you can not composite three non-cubic, non-polinomial, 1D bezier into a cubic polynomial 3D bezier.

 - The BezierCurve class also contains static functions used for getting points on first, second, and third order bezier curves. 
 - These functions take the positions of the anchor points as arguments.
 - Instances of the BezierCurve object use these same functions to calculate positions.
